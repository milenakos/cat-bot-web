MILENAKOS BOT PRIVACY POLICY
LAST UPDATED MARCH 12TH, 2025

Hi! We are Milenakos, operating Cat Bot, Word Bomb and various sites under minkos.lol domain.
Here is the information we and our bots collect, store, and use:
- Discord User/Channel/Server IDs - these are 17-19 digit long numbers which uniquely identify Users/Servers/Channels;
- Information you directly provide to us (various custom messages, settings, and images);

We might also temporarily use information such as message contents or usernames while you interact with our bots, but such information isnt't stored and is deleted after use.
  
Additionally, if you login to store.minkos.lol, your profile picture, Discord username and e-mail will be stored and used for delivery purposes.
Your e-mail address will be shared with Lavalane to provide you the checkout experience.

We only use this data to provide services to you.
We will retain your data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13 - as doesn't Discord's.
You can access, modify or delete your data by contacting us at legal@minkos.lol.

We utilize Cloudflare, Discord and Lavalane platforms.
To learn how Cloudflare collects, stores and uses your data, see their Privacy Policy at https://cloudflare.com/privacypolicy
