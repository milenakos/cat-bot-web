Milenakos Bot Privacy Policy
Last updated: September 29, 2025

Introduction
We are Milenakos, operator of Cat Bot, Word Bomb, catbot.shop, and services under the minkos.lol domain ("we", "us", "our"). This Privacy Policy describes the personal data we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, how long we keep it, and your rights.

1. Data controller
Milenakos (contact: legal@minkos.lol) is the data controller for the personal data described in this policy.

2. Information we collect
- Discord identifiers: User, Channel, and Server IDs (numeric IDs).
- Information you provide directly: custom messages, settings, images, profile information supplied during interactions or when registering on catbot.shop.
- Interaction data: message content, usernames, and other data processed temporarily while you interact with our bots. This data is used for the interaction and is deleted after use unless otherwise stated.
- Account data (catbot.shop): profile picture, Discord username, and email address — used to deliver purchases.
- Transaction/payment metadata: we share your email with Lavalane (payment processor) to complete checkout.

3. Purposes and legal bases for processing
We process data to:
- Provide and operate our bots and related services (performance of a contract).
- Deliver purchases and communicate about orders (performance of a contract).
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and detect fraud (legitimate interests).
- Comply with legal obligations (legal compliance).
- Improve services and analyze usage in aggregated/anonymized form (legitimate interests).
We will not use data for unrelated purposes without notice.

4. Sharing and third‑party processors
We use third‑party processors to operate services:
- Cloudflare (infrastructure)
- Discord (authentication, messaging)
- Lavalane (payments/checkout)
We may share necessary personal data with these providers to deliver the service. We require processors to maintain appropriate safeguards. We do not sell personal data.

5. Data retention
We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes described:
- Temporary interaction data (message contents, usernames used during interactions): deleted immediately after processing or within 24 hours unless required for troubleshooting or abuse investigation, in which case retained for up to 90 days.
- Account data (catbot.shop): retained while your account exists and for 24 months after account deletion for operational, fraud-prevention, and legal purposes, unless a longer retention is required by law.
- Transaction records and refund-related data: retained for 7 years for accounting and legal compliance.

6. Your rights
Where applicable, you may:
- Access the personal data we hold about you.
- Request correction or deletion of your personal data.
- Object to or restrict processing.
- Request data portability for data you provided.
To exercise rights, contact us at legal@minkos.lol. We may require verification and will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

7. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data (access controls, encryption in transit, regular updates). No system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. International transfers
Data may be stored or processed outside your country by our processors (Cloudflare, Discord, Lavalane). We use contractual safeguards and where required transfers based on appropriate legal mechanisms.

9. Children
Our service is not intended for children under 13 (or higher local minimum age). We do not knowingly collect data from children under that age. If we learn we have collected such data, we will take steps to delete it.

10. Links to other sites
Our bots may include links to third‑party sites and services. This policy does not cover their practices; please review their privacy policies.

11. Changes to this policy
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion. By continuing to use the service after modifications, you accept the updated policy. If you do not agree, stop using the service.
