We will not use data for unrelated purposes without notice.

4. Sharing and Third-Party Processors
We use third-party processors to operate services:
- Cloudflare (infrastructure)
- Discord (authentication, messaging)
- Lavalane (payments/checkout)
- Umami Analytics (analytics tracking)
We may share necessary personal data with these providers to deliver the service while requiring them to maintain appropriate safeguards.
We do not sell personal data.

6. Your Rights
Where applicable, you may:
- Access the personal data we hold about you.
- Request correction or deletion of your personal data.

To exercise your rights, contact us at legal@minkos.lol. We may require verification and will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

7. Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect personal data (access controls, encryption in transit, regular updates).
No system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

8. International Transfers
Data may be stored or processed outside your country by our processors (Cloudflare, Discord, Lavalane, and Umami).
We use contractual safeguards and, where required, transfers based on appropriate legal mechanisms.

Our service is not intended for children under 13 (or higher local minimum age).
We do not knowingly collect data from children under that age.
If we learn we have collected such data, we will take steps to delete it.

10. Links to Other Sites
Our bots may include links to third-party sites and services.
This policy does not cover their practices; please review their privacy policies.

11. Changes to This Policy
We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time in our sole discretion.
By continuing to use the service after modifications, you accept the updated policy.
If you do not agree, stop using the service.
