MILENAKOS BOT PRIVACY POLICY
LAST UPDATED FEBRUARY 4TH, 2025

Hi! We are Milenakos.
Here is the information we and our bots collect, store, and use:
- Discord User/Channel/Server IDs - these are 17-19 digit long numbers which uniquely identify Users/Servers/Channels;
- Information you directly provide to us (various custom messages, settings, and profile images);
- E-mail addresses of users who pay for our products, for delivery purposes.

We might also temporarily use information such as message contents or usernames while you interact with our bots, but those are't stored or collected.

We only use this data to provide services to you.
We will retain your data for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.
Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13 - as doesn't Discord's.
You can access, modify or delete your data by contacting us at legal@minkos.lol.

We utilize Cloudflare, Discord and Lavalane platforms.
To learn how Cloudflare collects, stores and uses your data, see their Privacy Policy at https://cloudflare.com/privacypolicy
To learn how Discord collects, stores and uses your data, see their Privacy Policy at https://discord.com/privacy
To learn how Lavalane collects, stores and uses your data, see their Privacy Policy at https://lava.top/en/docs/policy

Please note you might encounter links to other websites and services while using our bots.
You are advised to check their Terms of Service and Privacy Policies.

For any requests, questions or concerns about this policy, users may contact us at legal@minkos.lol.
