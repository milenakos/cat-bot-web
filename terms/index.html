Milenakos Bot Terms of Service
Last updated: September 29, 2025

Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using bots
operated by Milenakos ("Milenakos", "we", "us", or "our"). These Terms
govern your access to and use of our bots and related services.
By accessing or using our bots you agree to be bound by these Terms.
If you do not agree to these Terms, do not access or use our bots.

1. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your
jurisdiction) to use our bots. If you are under the required age, you must
not use the service except as permitted by applicable law and with parental
or guardian consent where required.

2. Acceptance and Changes to Terms
We may modify these Terms at any time in our sole discretion. By continuing
to access or use the bots after any modification, you accept and agree to
the modified Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must
stop using the bots.

3. Availability; Errors; Accuracy
We strive to keep our bots operational but make no guarantees.
Content and features may be updated, delayed, inaccurate, incomplete, or
unavailable. We reserve the right to correct errors, modify features, or
remove content without prior notice.

4. Accounts; Security
If you access any bots via your Discord account, you are responsible for
maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all
activity under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.
We are not liable for losses due to unauthorized access unless caused by
our gross negligence or willful misconduct.

5. Acceptable Use
You agree not to:
- Use the bots for illegal activities or to violate applicable laws.
- Infringe others’ intellectual property or privacy rights.
- Transmit viruses, malware, or other harmful code.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disrupt the bots.
- Spam, harass, abuse, or otherwise harm other users.

We reserve the right to remove content or restrict access that violates
these rules or that we reasonably deem objectionable.

6. User Content; License
You retain ownership of any content you submit (text, images, messages).
By submitting content, you grant Milenakos a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable license to use, host, store,
reproduce, modify, create derivative works of, publicly perform, and
display such content to operate, improve, and promote the service
(including in aggregated or anonymized form). You represent and warrant
that you have the rights necessary to grant this license.

7. Third-Party Links and Services
Our bots may include links or integrations with third-party websites,
services, or payment processors. We do not control third-party content and
are not responsible for their policies or practices. You should review
their terms and privacy policies before use.

8. Payments and Billing
We use third-party payment processors (for example, Lavalane) to process
payments. We do not store full payment card details. We may temporarily use
your email to deliver purchases. You authorize the payment processor to
charge your chosen payment method. You are responsible for accurate billing
information and any fees or taxes. If a chargeback is filed without
contacting us first, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
account.

9. Refund Policy
We offer refunds in accordance with the following policy:
Full refunds are available within 7 days of purchase if
the rain was not used. To request a refund, contact us:
  via Discord: @milenakos; or
  via email: refunds@minkos.lol.
We may require proof of purchase and other information to process refunds.

10. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access, without notice and at our sole
discretion, for any reason, including violations of these Terms.
Termination does not limit any other remedies available to us.

11. Warranty Disclaimer
THE BOTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, MILENAKOS
DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OPERATION,
OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL MILENAKOS, ITS
AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF
PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE
TERMS OR THE SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

13. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Milenakos and its
officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates from any claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the service, violation of these
Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

14. Intellectual Property
All trademarks, service marks, and trade names of Milenakos used herein are
the property of Milenakos. Except for the license you grant above for user
content, nothing in these Terms grants you any right, title, or interest in
Milenakos’s intellectual property.

15. Privacy
Our privacy practices are described in a separate Privacy Policy. By using
the service you agree that we may collect, use, and share data as described
in that policy.

16. Export Controls
You agree not to use the service in violation of applicable export and
re-export control laws.

17. Miscellaneous
- Entire Agreement: These Terms and the Privacy Policy constitute the
  entire agreement regarding the service.
- Severability: If any provision is invalid, the remainder remains in
  effect.
- Waiver: Failure to enforce a right is not a waiver of that right.
- Assignment: We may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part,
  without your consent. You may not assign these Terms without our prior
  written consent.
