Cat Bot Refund Policy
Last updated: January 3, 2026

Summary
- You may request a refund for Rain Minutes within 14 days of purchase.
- Refund requests must be sent via email to refunds@minkos.lol or via Discord to @milenakos.
- Refunds apply only to unused Rain Minutes credited to your Discord account; partial refunds for partially used minutes are handled pro rata (see details).

Eligibility
- Refund window: 14 days from the purchase date.
- The purchaser must be the Discord account that received the Rain Minutes.
- Rain Minutes already spent or consumed in the bot are not eligible for refund, except pro rata as described below.

How to Request a Refund
1. Email refunds@minkos.lol or message @milenakos on Discord within 14 days of purchase.
2. Provide:
   - Discord username (or user ID) that received the Rain Minutes,
   - Purchase date,
   - Reason for the refund request.
3. The support team will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.

Processing and Timing
- If eligible, refunds are processed within 7–14 business days after approval.
- Refunds are returned to the original payment method when possible. If the original method is unavailable, an alternate refund method (e.g., store credit) will be offered.

Partial Use / Pro Rata Refunds
- If some Rain Minutes were used, we calculate a pro rata refund equal to the value of unused minutes at the original purchase rate.
- If usage cannot be reliably determined, we may deny the refund or offer store credit at our discretion.

Denials and Disputes
- Refund requests that exceed 14 days, lack sufficient information, are associated with an account not matching the purchaser, or involve fraud/abuse will be denied.
- If you disagree with a denial, reply to the support response with any additional evidence; we will review and respond within 5 business days.

Changes and Contact
- We reserve the right to modify this policy; changes will be posted at catbot.shop and take effect immediately.
- Questions or disputes: refunds@minkos.lol or Discord @milenakos.
